# In-App Update Setup Guide

## Overview
This app now supports in-app updates for both Android and iOS platforms.

## Android Updates
- Uses Google Play's built-in in-app update API
- Can download and install updates directly in the app
- Supports both immediate and flexible updates

## iOS Updates
- Checks App Store for available updates
- Shows update dialog when newer version is available
- Redirects users to App Store for manual update
- Cannot install updates directly due to Apple's security restrictions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your App Store ID
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Select your app
3. Note the App ID (e.g., `1234567890`)
4. Or find it in your app's App Store URL: `https://apps.apple.com/app/idYOUR_APP_ID`

### 2. Update Configuration
1. Open `lib/config/app_config.dart`
2. Replace `YOUR_APP_STORE_ID` with your actual App Store ID:

```dart
static const String appStoreId = '1234567890'; // Your actual App Store ID
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
- The app will check for updates on startup (silently)
- If an update is available, it will show a dialog
- Users can tap "Update Now" to go to App Store
- Users can tap "Later" to dismiss the dialog

## How It Works

### iOS Flow:
1. App queries App Store API on startup
2. Compares current version with App Store version
3. If update available, shows dialog
4. User taps "Update Now" â†’ Opens App Store
5. User updates manually in App Store

### Android Flow:
1. App checks Google Play for updates
2. If update available, shows dialog
3. User can choose immediate or flexible update
4. Update downloads and installs automatically

## Configuration Options

In `lib/config/app_config.dart`, you can adjust:

- `updateCheckIntervalDays`: How often to check for updates
- `showUpdateDialogOnStart`: Whether to show dialog on app start
- `checkUpdatesSilentlyOnStart`: Whether to check silently on startup

## Testing

### For Development:
- Set a higher version number in `pubspec.yaml`
- The app will think an update is available
- Test the dialog and App Store redirect

### For Production:
- Publish your app to App Store
- Update the version in App Store Connect
- Test with the published version

## Notes

- iOS updates always redirect to App Store (Apple requirement)
- Android can install updates directly in the app
- The service handles both platforms automatically
- No additional setup needed for Android (uses existing Google Play integration)
